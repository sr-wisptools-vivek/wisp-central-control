## Getting and Setting Data Directly

The following end points are used for a more direct way of talking to the TR-069 ACS (Auto Configuration Server).  Even though you are getting access into the ACS, many things have been simplified for you.  For example, the list of `hosts` you get when using `/mr/acs/device/get` is put into a single easy to use list, rather than given to you as it is in the ACS, spread out into five different data trees.  You can thank us later.

## Get Data on ACS

This gives you the most recent data, on a device, from the ACS. The data returned will depend on the make and model of the equipment.  For instance, some routers don't have VoIP port, so a `get` will not return any VoIP related items.

Some values have an `item_id` which is used when updating the value using the `/mr/acs/device/set` call below.

```http
POST https://api.rncontrol.com/mr/acs/device/get
```

Sample post data
```js
{
    "id":"1267785"
}
```

Sample result
```js
{  
  "last_check_in":"1/2/2017 2:50 PM (10 days and 5 hours ago)",

    }
  ]
}
```

Sample error
```js
{
  "error": "denied",
  "reason": "Domain Error"
}
```
## Set Data on the ACS

Values can be set for items, returned in the `get` call, that have an `item_id`.  It's important to refer to the `item_id` returned in the `get`, as they same type of data might have a different `item_id` on a different make/model.  For example, the 2.4 GHz SSID is not always `item_id=67` on every device.

```http
POST https://api.rncontrol.com/mr/acs/device/set
```

This will update the Channel and SSID on the sample device. For values that are `true` or `false, the following are all accepted as true: "Enabled", true, "true" and 1.  Everything else is sent to the ACS as false.

Sample post data
```js
{
  id:1267785,
  values:[
    {
      item_id:66,
      value:6
    },
    {
      item_id:67,
      value:'TEST'
    }
  ]
}
```

I know this reply is quite bare, but there isn't much more to give you.  It does let you know that the ACS has accepted the change, placing it into the update queue.  You can do a follow up `get` to verify the actual data.

Sample result
```js
{
  acs_reply: "accepted"
}
```

Sample error
```js
{
  "error": "denied",
  "reason": "Domain Error"
}
```
## Reboot a Device

You can tell a device to reboot using the following end point.

```http
POST https://api.rncontrol.com/mr/acs/device/reboot
```

Sample post data
```js
{
    "id":"1267785"
}
```
Sample result
```js
{
  acs_reply: "accepted"
}
```

Sample error
```js
{
  "error": "denied",
  "reason": "Domain Error"
}
```

## Refresh Data on Device

Refreshing will tell the ACS to reach out to a device and request that it does a check in.  If the device is offline, this command will likely error out.

```http
POST https://api.rncontrol.com/mr/acs/device/refresh
```

Sample post data
```js
{
    "id":"1267785"
}
```
Sample result
```js
{
  acs_reply: "accepted"
}
```

Sample error
```js
{
  "error": "denied",
  "reason": "Domain Error"
}
```

## Check if a Device is Online

A quick call to see if the device has recently checked in with the ACS, indicating that it's online.

```http
POST https://api.rncontrol.com/mr/acs/device/online
```

Sample post data
```js
{
    "id":"1267785"
}
```
Sample result
```js
{
  online: true
}
```

Sample error
```js
{
  "error": "denied",
  "reason": "Domain Error"
}
```
